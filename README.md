# customer_segementation_lifetime_value
In this notebook, you will learn the most fundamental methodologies used in marketing analytics, and how to apply them to real-life data : segmentation, and lifetime value analysis. I have shown how you can extract, prepare your data, and how to analyse it with python. My goal is to make sure you acquire skills and techniques that can be applied immediately to real-life situations. Simply be aware that these skills are invaluable to have in the marketplace, but hard to learn. Be prepared to spend some time exploring the code on your own.
